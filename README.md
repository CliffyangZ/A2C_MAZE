## Training Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the straight maze to verify the setup
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for increasing average rewards
3. **Adjust Hyperparameters**: Modify learning rate, entropy coefficient as needed
4. **Render Frequency**: Use `render_every` parameter to balance visualization and speed

## Model Performance

- **Success Criteria**: Episode reward > 50 (reaching the goal)
- **Convergence**: Typically 200-800 episodes depending on maze complexity
- **Success Rate**: Target >80% success rate over 100 episodes

## Visualization

The environment renders in real-time showing:
- **Black squares**: Walls
- **White squares**: Free spaces
- **Green square**: Start position
